  <h2>Quantivity</h2>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>

  <p>People including myself face common issues with falling behind on our journey to mastery.<br> Reflecting, writing, seems like a lot of work so why not translate it to a simple number that<br> will indicate the level of productivity they’ve achieved per task. The purpose of this project <br>is to design the most minimal, easy to use, productivity web application using a point based <br>system of 1’s and 0’s.</p>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>Quantivity’s goal is to provide a simple tool that users can use to maximize their productivity.<br> This app has the ability to train the user’s minds by opening neural pathways to convince <br>themselves that there’s a way to compensate for such low productivity percentage by simply<br> making better choices for the next day (subconsciously setting a goal to aim for a higher <br>percentage than the day before). This kind of mental training can really strengthen the discipline <br>of users. The main target audience for this application is for anyone who is mastering a particular <br>skill whether it be programming, gaming, writing, sports, etc. The framework we will be using to<br> build this app is Node.js as it has gained trust from big companies like Trello, Linkedin, Paypal, etc. <br>It holds a reputation of it being easy and fast to learn. For backend development of this app, we <br>will be using Javascript and as for the frontend development, we will be using HTML and CSS.</p>
