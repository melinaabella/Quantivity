# Quantivity
A way to reflect your productivity in a quantified basis.

# Project Description:
Quantivity is a web application that will allow a user to keep track of their productivity when mastering a particular skill. In the main page, it will have a brief introduction of Quantivity as well as a login option for the user to keep track of their personal point based reports of their productivity. 

# After User logs in
When the user logs in, they will have access to a spreadsheet will similarly look like: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JvlMyqod9CICh_4IqCJgcCvZQT9D0WYBqm_4dlu5-N4/edit?usp=sharing 
- The topic, "Mastery" (highlighted in light orange) is a hyper link to a drop down menu of numbers (1-10). The user has the option to pick how many categories they wish to use and name those categories. Each category will have an option for the user to add a description. 

- As for the other cells below the dates of the week (highlighted in pink), that is where the user will be assigning points, (0 = did not accomplish task, 0.5 = halfway accomplished the task, 1 = fully accomplished the task) to any category they've finished or not underneath the same column (the same day). Each cell with points (0, 0.5, or 1) will have an option for the user to add notes that way they can reflect why and how they got certain points. 

- Then at the very bottom of the table of points, there will be a hyperlink to where the User can see a 'graphical representation' of how their week looked like and compare the line graph from other weeks. What's nice about this option is that it can average 5-7 days out of 7 total days, giving the user up to 2 days to relax and take a break. So this option is available to anyone with any style of work pace. 

# When User logs out
After the user logs out, they will have an option to go back to the main page.

# Overall
This web application will have simple, minimalistic functions: log in, assign points (0, 0.5, and 1) on whichever category they finished, and reflect by adding notes to the points or not.
